// Exercise 1.2
// ------------
// Creating a Cat class - Part 2

// A) In the previous exercise, Boots' name is not part of its object.
// Update the Cat class to accept have a name parameter and a breed parameter and
// then pass Boots' name and breed as arguments when you instantiate the boots object.
// When you are done, console.log the boots object
// and confirm that you have everything in there.

// By the way, Boots is a Simaese cat...
class Cat extends Boots {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    this.species = "cat";
    this.tiredness = 0;
    this.hunger = 0;
    this.loneliness = 0;
    this.happiness = 0;
    this.breed = "Siamese";
    this.name = "Boots";
  }
}

let Boots = new cat("Boots" && "Siamese");
console.log(boots);
